Project goal: to create a simple Chrome extension for lead tracking. Should have the ability to input data directly as well as save current window tab url. Data should persist beyond page refresh until deliberately deleted by user.

Utilized:
const
addEventListener
InnerHTML
input.value
parameters
template strings
localStorage
JSON.stringify, parse, and manifest file
objects in arrays
